      <h2>On Site Support</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to our remote support offering, we also provide an onsite support service for our deployed terminals. This service gives you peace of mind knowing that in the event of an issue, a qualified engineer will be available to respond promptly. Our onsite engineers are equipped with the necessary tools and expertise to diagnose and resolve hardware issues, and can also provide maintenance and updates to keep your EPOS systems running smoothly.
        <br/><br/>
        When combined with our advanced monitoring system, our engineers can proactively identify and resolve issues before they even impact your customers. This helps to minimise downtime and ensure that your EPOS systems are operating at optimal levels at all times.
        <br/><br/>
        However, we understand that having onsite resources can be costly, which is why we also offer a lean, cost-optimised service in combination with our remote support offering. By utilising our dedicated offsite help desk, we can diagnose and resolve software issues remotely, reducing the need for onsite resources. This approach not only helps to reduce costs, but also provides a more efficient and streamlined support experience for our clients.
        <br/><br/>
        Overall, our onsite and remote support offerings work together to provide a comprehensive support service that ensures your EPOS systems are always operational, efficient, and cost-effective.
